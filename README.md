# AsmMania
A Mania-type rhythm game made almost entirely in assembly. AsmMania is built for Manjaro (free open-source Linux distribution), utilizing only the X Window System (X11) and ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture). In theory, it is likely that this code will also run on most other Linux systems.

To control, simply use the EFJI or DFJK keys for lanes 1, 2, 3, 4.

# Compile
To compile, simply run `make` in the root folder of the repository.

This will create the binary file named `AsmMania`.

# Maps
Maps files use a custom binary format which is adapted from the osu!mania chart format, so it is theoretically possible to play any osu!mania map, however we will only provide a single map.

The chart is mapped by Dubtek, you can find the original download link [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1063740#mania/2363101).
